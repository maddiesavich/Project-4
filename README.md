The purpose of this project is to show skills in developing GUI's through Animation and Graphics as well as all other concepts learned.
This game is based around Lob Pong.

REQUIREMENTS:

Animated ball that bounces off of the walls and paddle.
Timer that counts down from 60 seconds and then restarts the round.
User awarded points when ball bounces off the panel.


EXTRA CREDIT:
